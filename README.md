1. ## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up the environment

   Providing the detailed instructions for project setup.

   ```bash
   git clone --branch main https://github.com/Madan007/super-telegram-forwarder.git
   cd super-telegram-bot

   # Install microservice feature dependencies
   cd forwarder
   npm install
   ```

1. ## üöÄ Docker Setup

   The `docker-compose` file requires few environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory. Docker compose will automatically pull the required environment variables from this file. Here's an example of my `.env` file

   ```docker
   TG_API_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   TG_API_HASH=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   TG_API_SESSION=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   TG_BOT_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   TG_BOT_USERNAME=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   TG_CHANNEL_SENDER=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   TG_CHANNEL_RECEIVER=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   ```

   With that set up you're ready to go !

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   > Things might go wrong the first time you run this command. If that happens, stop the process and re-run the command
